## Introduction

Git is a distributed version control system that enables you to track changes in your codebase efficiently. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides a centralized location for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories.

This repository aims to guide you through the basics of both Git and GitHub, helping you become proficient in version control and collaborative software development.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Additionally, create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.

## Basic Git Commands

Learn essential Git commands to manage your version-controlled projects effectively. Here are some key commands:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository>`: Clone a repository into a new directory.
- `git add <file>`: Add changes in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Record changes from the staging area to the repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch changes from a remote repository and integrate them into the current branch.
- `git push`: Push local changes to a remote repository.

## Understanding Git Workflow

Understand the basic Git workflow, including branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Learn how to create branches, switch between them, and merge changes seamlessly.

## GitHub Collaboration

Explore how to collaborate with others on GitHub. This includes forking repositories, creating pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts in a team setting.
